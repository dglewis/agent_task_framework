# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Agent Task Framework

## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

Developers and users interacting with AI coding agents frequently provide ambiguous or incomplete instructions. This leads to wasted time, incorrect results, and increased operational costs as the agent pursues a flawed interpretation of the task. There is a clear need for a mechanism to systematically deconstruct and clarify a user's request *before* the agent begins substantive work.

This document outlines the requirements for the **Agent Task Framework (ATF)**, a tool designed to bridge the gap between user intent and agent execution.

## 2. Target User

The primary target user is a developer or technical user who delegates coding, refactoring, or investigative tasks to an AI agent.

## 3. Product Goals

*   **Increase Reliability:** Drastically reduce the rate of mission failure due to misinterpretation of the initial prompt.
*   **Improve Efficiency:** Prevent the agent from spending time and resources on incorrect paths by ensuring the task is well-defined upfront.
*   **Formalize Clarification:** Move from ad-hoc clarification to a systematic, programmatic process based on a defined set of principles.
*   **Create a Reusable Tool:** Build a standalone utility that can be integrated into various agent-based workflows.

## 4. Core Requirements & Features

### 4.1. Task Analysis

*   The system must accept a freeform, natural language user request as its primary input.
*   The system must analyze this request against the core principles defined in `framework_principles.md`.

### 4.2. Question Generation

*   The system's primary output shall be a structured list of clarifying questions.
*   These questions must be designed to resolve ambiguities related to the task's Objective, Scope, Deliverable, and Success Criteria.
*   If the initial request is deemed clear and unambiguous according to the framework, the system should indicate that no clarification is needed.

### 4.3. Interaction Model

*   The tool will initially be implemented as a Python library/module. A user of the library will import and call a function or method to get the clarifying questions.
*   Future iterations may include a command-line interface (CLI) or a simple web UI.
