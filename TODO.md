# Agent Task Framework - TODO List

## ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED: Complete DSPy Optimization Pipeline Working!

**The Agent Task Framework has reached practical execution level:**
- âœ… Takes ambiguous user requests and generates high-quality, structured clarifying questions
- âœ… Automatically follows our 4 core framework principles (Objective, Scope, Deliverable, Success Criteria)  
- âœ… Full end-to-end DSPy optimization with successful bootstrapping (2/2 traces)
- âœ… Proven integration with local LLMs via Ollama
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite and documentation

**Ready for real-world usage and further development!**

---

## Phase 1: Scaffolding & Initial Implementation âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] Set up project structure and Git repository.
- [x] Create project documentation (PRD, Technical Design, Framework Principles).
- [x] Implement the initial version of the DSPy clarifier module in `atf/main.py`.

## Phase 2: Validation & Refinement âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] Set up the Python virtual environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- [x] Run the `atf/main.py` script and validate that it connects to the Ollama model and generates clarifying questions.
- [x] Refine the DSPy prompt and signature in `TaskClarificationSignature` to improve the quality of the generated questions.
- [x] Add comprehensive training examples for DSPy optimization.
- [x] Implement ValidationSignature for LLM-based output evaluation.
- [x] Successfully integrate DSPy BootstrapFewShot optimizer.
- [x] Achieve dramatic improvement in output quality and structure.

## Phase 3: Testing & Hardening âœ… MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED

- [x] Build a formal test suite in the `tests/` directory to run automated checks on the clarifier's output.
- [x] Add test coverage measurement with pytest-cov (baseline: 37%).
- [x] Implement the DSPy compiler (`BootstrapFewShot`) with examples to optimize the prompt.
- [x] **ðŸŽ‰ SOLVED:** Resolve bootstrapping validation issue (ClarifierModule.forward() parameter mismatch).
- [x] **ðŸŽ‰ SUCCESS:** Complete end-to-end DSPy optimization pipeline now working (2/2 traces bootstrapped).
- [x] **ðŸŽ‰ ACHIEVED:** Practical execution level - framework generates high-quality structured questions.
- [ ] Add error handling for common failure modes (e.g., model connection issues, missing principle file).
- [ ] Improve test coverage beyond current 37% baseline.
- [ ] Add more comprehensive integration tests.

## Phase 4: Documentation & Polish

- [x] Create comprehensive documentation suite (PRD, Technical Design, Framework Principles, DSPy Methodology).
- [x] Add DSPy for Beginners guide.
- [x] ~~Document current limitation with bootstrapping validation.~~ **RESOLVED: No longer applicable**
- [ ] Create usage examples and tutorials.
- [ ] Add documentation for the successful DSPy optimization pipeline.
- [ ] Create demo script showcasing the framework's capabilities.

## Future Work

- [ ] Explore alternative DSPy optimization approaches that work better with our module design.
- [ ] Explore creating a simple CLI or Web UI for easier interaction.
- [ ] Investigate packaging the tool for distribution via PyPI.
